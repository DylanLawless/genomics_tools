IMPORTANT NOTICE:  

In late December, we will be making some changes to the Dosage Sensitivity FTP
download files.

The first change will slightly alter the Haploinsufficiency and
Triplosensitivity Phenotype OMIM IDs columns to support ontologies other than
OMIM. Consequently, the column headers will be renamed from “Haploinsufficiency Phenotype OMIM ID” to just “Haploinsufficiency Disease ID”, and
“Triplosensitivity Phenotype OMIM ID” to just “Triplosensitivity Disease ID.”
To distinguish between the multiple ontologies, the ID will now include the
relative prefix (for example, MONDO:0010758 or OMIM:314580). For backward
compatibility, any entries without an ontology prefix can be considered an OMIM
ID.  For example, an entry of 314580 can be treated equivalent to OMIM:314580.
This change will only affect the files:

              Clingen_gene_curation_list_GRCh37.tsv
              Clingen_gene_curation_list_GRCh38.tsv
              Clingen_region_curation_list_GRCh37.tsv
              Clingen_region_curation_list_GRCh38.tsv
 

The second change will allow for full representation of PAR in the FTP files.
As you know, PAR genes have genomic coordinates on both the X and Y chromosomes,
however, due to a programming error we are only presenting one. The genes
currently affected are WASIR1, VAMP7, and CSF2RA.

To fully represent both sets of data for PAR genes, we will include two lines
within each relevant FTP files for each PAR gene. One line will represent the X
chromosome data, and one line will represent the Y chromosome data.  For current
consumers of the FTP file data who do not care about full representation of PAR
genes, this should have no impact, as the second line will merely overwrite the
first on import.  For those consumers who are interested in full representation
of PAR genes, minimal changes to the import scripts should allow collecting of
all data. This change will affect all gene curation files.

If you have any questions or concerns related to these changes, please respond
to clingen@clinicalgenome.org by November 19th, 2021. Shortly thereafter, we
will send out a second notice, serving as both a reminder and addressing any
concerns. The second notice will also include a more definitive date on when
the changes will become effective.

Best Regards,

The ClinGen Dosage Sensitivity Team

This site holds files produced by the Dosage Sensitivity Curation Working Group of the ClinGen Consortium (formerly the ISCA Evidence based review committee). The goal of this group is to curate regions of the genome with respect to their dosage sensitivity. More information about this effort can be found on these sites:

https://dciw.clinicalgenome.org/

https://www.clinicalgenome.org/working-groups/dosage-sensitivity-curation/

The files in this directory contain data for genes and regions that have been through the review process. These files are updated daily. Files are available for genes and regions localized on both GRCh37 and GRCh38.

tsv files: The tsv files have a header and contain all of the curation information found on the ClinGen Dosage Sensitivity Map web pages:

ClinGen_gene_curation_list.tsv: tab separated file for gene curation
ClinGen_region_curation_list.tsv: tab separated file for region curation

BED files: BED files are available for gene curation. There are separate files for haploinsufficiency and triplosensitivity as the BED file only has one column for 'score'. Because the score column expects a number rather than text, the following scores have been converted to numbers:
Dosage sensitivity unlikely: 40
Gene associated with autosomal recessive phenotype: 30

For more information on scoring: https://dciw.clinicalgenome.org/help.shtml

ClinGen_triplosensitivity_gene.bad: BED file with triplosensitivity scores

ClinGen_recurrent_CNV_V1.1.aed - This file contains recurrent copy number variations (CNV) that have been, or are in the process of being, reviewed by the recurrent CNV ClinGen DSC Subgroup. This file is available in genome build hg19 and hg38 and can be opened in ChAS software. The orange bars represent each recurrent region. The black bars represent the segmental duplication clusters/breakpoints. 

ClinGen_recurrent_CNV_V1.1.bed - This file contains recurrent copy number variations (CNV) that have been, or are in the process of being, reviewed by the recurrent CNV ClinGen DSC Subgroup. This file is available in genome build hg19 and hg38 and can be opened in array analysis software that utilizes .bed files as well as the UCSC genome browser. The orange bars represent each recurrent region. The black bars represent the segmental duplication clusters/breakpoints.
