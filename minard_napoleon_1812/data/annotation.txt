Figurative Map of the successive losses in men of the French Army in the Russian campaign 1812-1813.

Drawn by Mr. Minard, Inspector General of Bridges and Roads in retirement. 
Paris, 20 November 1869.

––––––––––––––––––––––

The numbers of men presented by the widths of the colored zones at the rate of one millimeter for ten thousand men; they are also written across the zones. The red indicates the men who entered Russia, the black those who left. 

The information used to draw up the map was taken from the works of Messrs. Thiers, de Ségur, de Fezensac, de Chambray and the unpublished diary of Jacob, pharmacist in the army since October 28. 

In order to make the eye better judge the reduction of the army, I assumed that the corps of Prince Jerome and Marshal Davoust, which had been detached to Minsk and Mohilow and joined towards Orscha and Witebsk, had still marched with the army.



Carte Figurative des pertes succesives en hommes de l’Armée Française dans la campagne de Russie 1812-1813.

Dressée par M. Minard, Inspecteur Général des Ponts et Chaussées en retraite. 
Paris, le 20 Novembre 1869.

––––––––––––––––––––––

Les nombres d’hommes présentés par les largeurs des zones colorées à raison d’un millimètre pour dix mille hommes ; ils sont de plus écrits en travers des zones. Le rouge désigne les hommes qui entrent en Russie, le noir ceux qui en sortent. 

Les renseignements qui ont servi à dresser la carte ont été puisés dans les ouvrages de MM. Thiers, de Ségur, de Fezensac, de Chambray et le journal inédit de Jacob, pharmacien de l’armée depuis le 28 Octobre. 

Pour mieux faire juger à l’œil la diminution de l’armée, j’ai supposé que les corps du prince Jérôme et du Maréchal Davoust qui avaient été détachés sur Minsk et Mohilow et ont rejoint vers Orscha et Witebsk, avaient toujours marché avec l’armée.
