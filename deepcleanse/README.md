## Data source
The data was produced as shown in msa2file.
This outputs a dataframe with one column per position and one row per sample;
and basic genotype matrix based on amino acids.
The labels are supplied in a second file, but the rownames also list the same info in this case.

A PCA is made from the genetic matrix.
