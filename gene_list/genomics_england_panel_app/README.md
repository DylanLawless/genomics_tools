Gene coordiates were used to construct a bed file for use as a virtual panel.

Gene names were mapped to coordinates using http://www.ensembl.org/biomart

The dataset used was: 
ensembl genes 104
Human genes (GRCh38.p13)

The input was a list of gene names (518 from Genomics England panel app for PID v2.1 20200224).
gene names source from filename: 
ge_panel_app_Primary_immunodeficiency_v2.1_20200224.tsv

The output was TSV format:
Gene stable ID, gene name, chromosome/scaffold name, gene start, gene end.
filename: 
ge_panel_app_Primary_immunodeficiency_v2.1_20200224_coordinate_grch38p13.tsv
